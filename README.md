# Machine Learning

I implement several machine learning methods from scratch to analyze their behaviours on the different datasets they learn on, and their resulting outputs on the datasets they predict on. For each new project, I go through each steps of the machine learning process:
1. Data Importing
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
3. Model Implementation
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Predictions
6. Additional Experimentations

## Repository Description

Each folder is a separate project. They each include: 
* a PDF Report (.pdf) where I analyze my results and summarize my findings.
* a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) where I implement the ML method and go through the 6 steps stated above.
* a python (.py) file which is simply the same Jupyter Notebook exported as a python file.

### Projects Overview

A brief summary of the projects in this repository. Further details can be found in their reports.

* [**KNN_DT**](https://github.com/e-lye/MachineLearning/tree/main/KNN_DT) (K-Nearest Neighbours and Decision Tree)
    * K-Nearest Neighbour
        * Predictions on the mortality of hepatitis patients, based on their health information that were a mix of categorical and continuous features.
    * Decision Tree
        * Predictions on the presence of diabetic retinophany in patients, based on their's health information that were a mix of categorical and continuous features. 
        * This dataset of information differs from the one used in our KNN implementation.
* [**LogisticRegression**](https://github.com/e-lye/MachineLearning/tree/main/LogisticRegression) (Logistic Regression and Multiclass Regression)
    * Logistic Regression
        * Predictions on the positivity/negativity of movie reviews, based on the vocabulary used in the review.
    * Multiclass Regression
        * Predictions on the categories that news articles falls under, based on the vocabulary used in the articles.
* [**NeuralNetwork**](https://github.com/e-lye/MachineLearning/tree/main/NeuralNetwork) (Multi-layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Networks)
    * Multi-layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Networks
        * Predictions on the clothing type (T-Shirt, Trousers, etc.) of an image, based on the images' RGB pixel data.
